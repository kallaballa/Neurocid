Installing libnoise:

1.  Make!

CXXFLAGS='-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer ...options of choice...' make

Using compiler optimizations for libnoise is *strongly recommended*.  Using the
unoptimized library is roughly a fifth as fast as using -O3 on my test
computer.

2.  Install!

The 'include' directory should be copied to your software include directory,
usually /usr/local/include, with an appropriate name.  I use

  cp -R include /usr/local/include/noise

Similarly, the *contents* of the 'lib' directory should go into your library
directory (usually /usr/local/lib).  Once you've done that, run 'ldconfig',
then make a symlink from LIBDIR/libnoise.so to LIBDIR/libnoise.so.0.  I use:

  cp lib/* /usr/local/lib
  ldconfig
  ln -s /usr/local/lib/libnoise.so.0 /usr/local/lib/libnoise.so

At this point, you should be able to include libnoise in your projects using

  #include <noise/noise.h>

and

  g++ ...options... -lnoise

At some point we'll automate this process.
