DISCLAIMER.

This directory contains some test files to check the validity of the
installation.  Because some of the procedures involve the use of random
number generators, the results may differ if installed on a different
system.

To run the tests, compile the program, and enter "make".  Differences
between the output of the current program and the "official" outputs will
be printed.  The command "make update" saves the latest outputs as the
"official" outputs.

The results in this directory were generated on a Sun Ultra 5
running SunOS (Solaris) 5.8.  Executions on other platforms are quite
unlikely to produce identical results, primarily due to the difference
in random number generators, which is used extensively in the generation
of data sets and execution of the algorithm.
