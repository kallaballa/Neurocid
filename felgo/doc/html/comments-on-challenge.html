<ul>
<li>I worked in a branch, so I can relax project disciplin (e.g&#x2e;: allow myself to make uncontained or incomplete commits by mistake to safe reviewing time)</li>
<li>I disabled Neurocid features that were in the way and are not strictly necessary (e.g&#x2e;: like compiling to javascript using emscripten)</li>
<li>Where possible I ignored Neurocid issues.</li>
<li>I didn't fix issues/warnings in third-party code (e.g&#x2e;: Box2D).</li>
<li>I held back on beautifying the App and the Docs because you are looking for a backend hacker.</li>
<li>I made sure the project can be edited, build and run with and without QT-Creator.</li>
<li>I didn't test and benchmark to a professional extent but i made sure it runs on Ubuntu, Debian and OpenSUSE.</li>
<li>I didn't test for Mac OSX at all (which is a supported target of the master-branch)</li>
<li>I chose a quite ambigous task knowing it is significantly more work than required, because i wanted to implement something that wouldn't go to waist, no matter what.</li>
<li>In general it would be very nice if you could provide a full Felgo-qdoc-tutorial with config a qdoc document, style-sheets and assets.</li>
<li>Most of the time I'm not a last minute guy but job, family and virus-life took their toll.</li>
<li>I didn't include the appendix (just) to show off. If focus/given directions/time allow(s) it, I regard doing a tutorial as testing a tutorial (in projects I am involved in)</li>
<li>I didn't include the qt/qtdoc pitfalls that i encountered. e.g&#x2e;: it took quite some time to find out that source documentation can't be in source files and doesn't warn about it. try to search for it :)</li>
